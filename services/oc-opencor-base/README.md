# opencor

OpenCOR is a cross-platform modelling environment, which can be used to organise, edit, simulate and analyze CellML and SED-ML files. More information can be found here: https://opencor.ws/

## Usage

As an o²S²PARC service, it accepts two inputs: a model URL file and an optional configuration file. The model URL can come from the physiom model repository, such as  https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/5f5/rawfile/125f548ce204c1d815298d2c8c1d9b774d89e3a7/mcintyre_richardson_grill_model_2001.sedml and the cofiguration file can be used to customize the simulation and initial states of the model. More information can be found on the OpenCOR repository, specifically about the docker image used as this service's base: https://github.com/opencor/docker.
